Let’s start by install Nginx in our instance, and we do that by running the following:
sudo apt-get install nginx
nginx -v

Once we verify that Nginx is installed in our instance, we can configure it to work as a reverse-proxy.
Let’s edit the default file which exists in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
server {
   listen         80 default_server;
   listen         [::]:80 default_server;
   server_name    localhost;
   root           /usr/share/nginx/html;
location / {
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
   }
}
After saving, we need to restart the Nginx service and we do that by running the following command:
sudo service nginx restart
